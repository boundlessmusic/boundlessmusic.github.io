    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>Curious on how to start finding music?</p>
    <p>Here are some resources I've compiled for getting started.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Blogs</h2>
    <p>Blogs are some of the best resources available for finding new music, especially music which isn't on streaming sites (see: a majority of non-western music). Blogs sometimes specialize in sharing music from a certain region in the world, be it a country or a continent. They are filled with knowledge, and I use them constantly when discovering new music. I've listed the blogs I use in music exploration below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://thewealthofthewise.blogspot.com/">The Wealth of the Wise</a>. A blog ran by Matthew LaVoie, who hosted Voice of America's Music Time in Africa show for many years, started a blog where he shares his personal treasure trove of cassetes and wealth of information.</li>
            <li><a href="https://awesometapes.com/blog/">Awesome Tapes From Africa</a>. Brian Shimkovitz's blog, where he shares some tapes from his personal collection that he hasn't already re-released through his label.</li>
            <li><a href="https://themusicalgoldilockszone.blogspot.com/">The Musical Goldilocks Zone</a>. Ran by Alex Poe, it features a wide variety of music styles, as well as some mixtapes which he has curated himself.</li>
            <li><a href="https://archive.org/download/jillem-full-archive">Holland Tunnel Dive</a>. Unfortunately, this amazing blog ran by Jillem came to an abrupt and tragic end once Zippyshare announced its closure. Thankfully, dedicated folks have pieced together his wonderful blog for all to appreciate through the Internet Archive.</li>
